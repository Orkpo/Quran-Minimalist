			Assalamu Alaikum,<br>
			Since the beginning of human race, <u>Allah</u> <i>(Subhan wa t'ala)</i> has sent many prophets (Alaihimus salaam) among nations to guide them to <u>His</u> Jannah by following <u>His</u> commands. However <u> Allah</u> <i>(SWT)</i> through his infinite wisdom and judgment decided to reveal the last of <u>His</u> revelations -  <span style="background-color: #187bbc"> The Holy Quran </span> almost 1400 years ago to <u>His</u> greatest creation - <strong>Muhammad</strong> - May Allah's mercy and peace be upon him.<br>
			<br>
			<span style="background-color: #187bbc">The Quran</span> has been preserved in such a unique way in which no other book has ever been preserved. Indeed, <span style="background-color: #187bbc">The Quran </span> has been preserved from word to word, letter to letter. It's message has already reached the farthest of land and the ever increasing power of modern technology has only helped this journey.<br>
			<br>
			However, still a significant portion of the world doesn't have access to high-speed internet,
			neither does the population have high-end devices to support most of the apps and websites that hosts <span style="background-color: #187bbc">The Quran</span> due to them being big in file size or their heavy device-resource usage.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			This project is hence named - <span style="background-color: #187bbc">The Quran Project - Minimalist Interface Version</span>. We wish that this website would be a medium through which those under-priviledged truth-seekers would be able to read the Last Revelation from the comfort of their device. <br>
			<br>
			Note that, this is Dawah project and it's usage is completely free of cost. Being non-profit is a great way for us to feel tranquility, knowing that the only reward we wish is from <u>Allah</u> <i>(SWT)</i>. However, if you want, you can consider donating us so that we can further develop this project and host it with it's own domain, in it's own server - for faster loading time and more control over the project. Alternatively, You can also help this cause by actively participating and improving the code. If you are interested please contact the <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><a href="developer.html" target="new">Developers</a></span> @ <span style="background-color: #187bbc"><a href="https://t.me/AATechnologies"><code>Telegram</code></a></span><br><br>
